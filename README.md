# Introduction
Our project began when we started studying Computer Engineering at university. It focuses on supporting communities, businesses, schools, and the environment. This project aims to integrate the theory learned in classrooms with practical application, fostering teamwork and implementing concepts from various subjects studied.  

The project was developed by three students for a local company: Ampla Refrigeração, located in [Fernandópolis - SP](#Location)

# Objective
To implement a practical application that meets the needs of the chosen area. Our project focused on assisting a commercial company by creating its own website, as it did not have this tool available in its establishment.  

Our website aims to provide the company with the opportunity to expand its brand and reach more customers through the accessibility it offers. This will help boost sales by leveraging marketing and showcasing the company's products to users.

# Application
We implemented our project remotely, as all group members are engaged in extracurricular work and did not have sufficient extra time to provide a formal presentation to the company's manager regarding the concept we aimed to develop. However, despite these factors, we managed to execute our project in a way that met the university's standards.

In the application, only the website interface was developed along with a brief form. When correctly filled out, the form redirects the user to the company's WhatsApp with an initial inquiry message.

For the company, the data entered in the form is saved, ensuring that when the user sends a message, their contact information—such as name, phone number, and email—is already registered. This feature streamlines communication between the company and its clients, optimizing customer service and contact management.

# Resume
		The project aimed to develop a commercial website for the company Ampla Refrigeração.
The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There were some unforeseen challenges regarding the integration of the database due to time constraints during development. However, since the website's functionality does not depend on the database, we were able to implement it without impacting the project.

The main focus of the website was to create an interface where users can pre-register by providing their full name, phone number, and email. This registration directs them to direct contact with the company for purchase verification, quotes, inquiries, or, if necessary, the maintenance of previously purchased products.
